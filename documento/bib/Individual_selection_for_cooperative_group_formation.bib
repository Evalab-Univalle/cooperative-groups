        abstract = {It is well known that certain environmental conditions, such as a spatially structured population, can promote the evolution of cooperative traits. However, such conditions are usually assumed to be externally imposed. In this paper, we present a model that allows the conditions that promote or hinder cooperation to arise adaptively via individual selection. Consequently, instead of selection simply favouring cooperation under imposed environmental conditions, in our model selection also operates on the conditions themselves via a niche construction process. Results are presented that show that the conditions that favour cooperation can evolve, even though those that favour selfish behaviour are also available and are initially selected for. }
